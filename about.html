    <div class="profile-description">
        <p>Most of my career was spent in financial services.  Primarily I managed fixed income portfolios for insurance companies.
        I established the Insurance Management Asset division at Bank of America, managing $5.5 Billion of fixed income assets. Later in my career, I sold
    fixed income assets to institutions.  In addition, I earned my CFP and managed assets for individuals. </p>
    <p>Early in the pandemic, I discovered an aptitude and interest in programming and became adept at web development. 
        I currently serve as a member of the development team at Foodboss, an online food ordering platform.  Althought I primarily work on the front end,
        I have experience with the full stack.  I am proficient in React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  On the backend, I have worked
        with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL in addition to less familiar technologies such as hapi and knex.  I have also
        worked extensively several third party packages such as Retool, Expo, and React Native.
